# PWA using COBOL Backend (using COM+)

This project is basically design to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) where the backend processing uses a Cobol API. The Cobol source program herein is coded in Microfocus Cobol Ver3.1 and package in Microsoft component-based binary files (.DLL under COM+).


If you run into any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out on our on my email adress (infodynamicsrene@gmail.com) and I usually anwser you back in a day or two depending on how things are going and the importance of the queries.

## Contributing

All codes herein in this project is designed and coded by me (yes! my name is Rene Aquino Surop). Though this is my first project which (I hope) will be uploaded in Github. Please feel free to check or Google me up for my credentials.

## Licensing

This project is openly governed as an OpenSource project and I hope you will be happy about it because I am happy sharing it to all of you (well, if someone is looking at it)

## Credits

The materials for this project were made available through a collaboration of Git, Node.js and Microfocus Cobol (I am using an old MERANT NetExpress V3.10) application development tooling.

## Other Links

Well, most of it are viewing youtube learning modules before coding this project. Except of course Cobol programming wherein you really have to be experienced coding in this terrific machine language and learn the syntax from it. Talking about it, you could also utilize your web design expertise in coding the PWA and these are HTML, CSS and Javascripting codes.
